Mostly personal experiences and lessons learned on using LC29H(DA) and LC29H(BS) modules from Waveshare

## Lessons learned

###LC29H(DA)
#### Got to aroud +/-7cm accuracy with RTK base station 100km away, thats nice.

###LC29H(BS)
#### Default baudrate was 921600 and NOT 115200 - wasted whole day on dealing with gibberish in terminal and failing communication with QGNNS tool.
#### IPEX 1 to SMA cable was faulty and had no continuity - another day wasted on dealing with "no signal" when module was moved to its final location
